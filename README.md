## Inout - India's Premier Hackathon 2.0 

Hackathons provide a venue for self-expression and creativity through technology. People with technical backgrounds come together, form teams around a problem or idea, and collaboratively code a unique solution from scratch - these generally take shape in the form of websites, mobile apps, and robots. So prepare yourself for a weekend filled with learning new technologies, building amazing products and making new friends all within the span of 30 hours.

#My Experience with this hackathon(30 hours they eat, sleep and code)

Inout was my first hackathon.I can only say winning a Hackathon is very difficult but i was amazed to see a lot of people with different ideas coming together on a platform to show their skills for a specific purpose in 30 hours.Somehow I implemented my idea
and presented before them.Got knowledge about using API so extremly gateful to EXOTEL people who helped me a lot during hackathon.

## About this idea

Actually the theme was to work for the betterment OF the Rural Areas so according to the theme I selected my Idea to provide health care center which
will provide blood ,medicine ,ambulance etc health facilities to remote ares of india by their phone to desired NGO which will be sorted 
out by our database and Service provided by Exotel.

1)NGO can contact the seller of medical facilities accross India by a WEB application provided.

2)Rural people can contact a phone number which will take their pincode and contact one of the nearest NGO for help.

3)Exotel provided us free service and their nrok software for making the script run online.
